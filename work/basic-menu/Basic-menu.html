        <p>An ancient Japanese breed, the Shiba Inu is a little but well-muscled dog once employed as a hunter. Today, the spirited, good-natured Shiba is the most popular companion dog in Japan. The adaptable Shiba is at home in town or country. Brought to America from Japan as recently as 60 years ago, Shibas are growing in popularity in the West and are already the most popular breed in their homeland. Their white markings combined with their coloring (red, red sesame, or black and tan) and their alert expression and smooth stride makes them almost foxlike. They're sturdy, muscular dogs with a bold, confident personality to match.</p>
        <p>Most Shibas are fairly energetic and love to go for walks. They are not so hyper that they will climb the walls if they don't get daily exercise, but a Shiba owner should be dedicated to exercising the dog, especially if the dog doesn't have an adequate yard in which to exercise himself. </p>
        <p>The one thing every Shiba owner must know is that a Shiba can never, ever be considered reliable off lead unless in a confined area.</p>
